Put the picture you want to print in the same directory as the python file
Write the images name in the right place in the code as instructed in comments
When you run the code, you will get a rough estimate in black and white, how the final picture is going to look
If you dont like the estimate, you can shut down the code and play with the filter values to get a better result
When you are happy with the estimate, go in paint
There are 3 different shades that you can draw
When you press "e" it starts to draw the lightes shade
"w" the second lightest and "q" the darkest
I suggest you to go in this order for the best result
Remember to change the color manually after each part of the drawing
